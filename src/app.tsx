Heres some code, \`<div></div>\`, between 2 backticks.

\`\`\`
// this is multi-line code:

function anotherExample(firstLine, lastLine) {
  if (firstLine == '\`\`\`' && lastLine == '\`\`\`') {
    return multiLineCode;
  }
}
\`\`\`

Or _italic_.
Or... **_both!_**

There's also [links](https://www.freecodecamp.com), and
